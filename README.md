EdgeLedger Website for HTML / CSS 

EdgeLedger Website is a sample work for a company. Also, I made this project with the tutor to improve my HTML / CSS skillset.
There is a mobile friendly css and wide_screen css file. 
A little "php" for Email send button.
JavaScript used for Smooth Scrolling and map stuff.
